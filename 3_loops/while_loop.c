/*
The while()â€¦ statement has the following syntax:

while( continuation_expression ) statement_body

It consists of a continuation_expression and a loop body. 
At each iteration of the while loop, the continuation_expression is evaluated. 
If its result is true, statement_body is executed and continuation_expression is evaluated again. 
When the continuation_expression evaluates to false, the loop ends; the execution resumes after statement_body. 
If continuation_expression initially evaluates to false, the statement_body loop is never executed.
